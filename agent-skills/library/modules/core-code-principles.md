description: "Sets the principles for work with code: test first, growing in layers, long-term decisions, reuse and code smells; and how it is verified: let code decide what code can decide, make every check able to fail. Covers any work with code, including work handed to other agents; the gate a script runs for a plan or a review is owned by the gate module."

# Core principles for code

## Building

- Work test first, in small slices, when the behavior is clear enough to specify (a feature or a bug fix). Write one focused test for one behavior and confirm it fails for the expected reason; make the smallest change that passes; refactor while green; then take the next behavior. For a bug, start with a regression test that reproduces it, and if it does not fail as expected, investigate before changing production code.
- Grow in layers and decide for the long term. Start from the smallest version that works end to end and extend it one verified step at a time; the scope of a step is small, but not the quality of its decisions. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
- Reuse before building. Prefer an established pattern, a well-maintained library or an existing dependency to a new abstraction or a reimplementation. Check the repository and its dependencies before assuming a capability is missing; if a new shape is necessary, keep it local and explain why.
- Avoid these smells, with their fixes. A documented repository standard overrides them.
  - Duplicated logic in the change: extract it into one function.
  - Speculative generality, meaning abstraction, parameters or hooks nobody asked for: delete them and add them back when a real need shows.
  - Middle man, a function or class that only passes the call on: call the real target.
  - Shotgun surgery, one change forcing scattered edits: gather what changes together into one module.

## Verifying

- Let code decide what code can decide. Cover every required behavior with a test, type check or script whose result decides. A reading of the code is not evidence of what a run can show: an LLM reading LLM-written code is a probabilistic system checking another.
- A check must be able to fail. Show it failing once, against a wrong input or a throwaway copy of the code with the defect put back, before you rely on it.
- Never weaken an existing test or check to make work pass.
- What code cannot decide (visual quality, opinion, whether the spec is right) stays with a person and is reported as unverified, not as passed. No check for a changed behavior is a gap, not a pass.
- Report what ran and what came out, failures included. Work is done when the requested behavior is covered and the relevant tests and the nearest affected gate pass; work that is not verified is not done.
- The person or the approved plan decides what the tests specify. Prototypes, exploration, documentation, visual experiments and trivial configuration are exempt.
